## Steps for Data Collection

### 1. Pre-Investigation Preparations

- **Objective**: To prepare all necessary equipment and resources for the data collection process.
- [ ] Verify all equipment is functional and calibrated.
- [ ] Prepare data collection sheets or digital methods for recording observations.

---

### 2. Area Identification

- **Objective**: To identify and mark the areas where data will be collected.
- [ ] Refer to preliminary research or witness testimony to identify areas of interest. Please use the Lead Location protocols and contact your Team Lead for briefing.
- [ ] Mark these areas on a map for easy navigation and data point research.

---

### 3. Witness Testimony

- **Objective**: To collect firsthand accounts of anomalous phenomena.
- [ ] Identify and approach potential witnesses. Please use the witness contact protocol before doing this and contact your Team Lead for briefing.
- [ ] Record their accounts as audio/video recordings.

### 6. Record Methods and Equipment

- **Objective**: To document the methods and equipment used during data collection.
- [ ] Point a camera at the equipment readout while explaining what is being tested.
- [ ] Livestream this process for real-time data capture and public transparency and for your protection.

---

### 7. Capture Measurements

- **Objective**: To collect quantitative data.
- [ ] Use the various sensors and equipment to capture measurements.
- [ ] Record these measurements, by pointing a camera at the readout during a livestream for the full duration of measurement, indicating both normal and abnormal readings in narration.

## Conclusion

Following this data collection protocol ensures the consistency and reliability of the data collected during field investigations. This protocol is a living document and may be updated as new methods and equipment become available. And if it is not clear yet, contact your Team Lead for briefing before finalizing and initiating any protocols.
