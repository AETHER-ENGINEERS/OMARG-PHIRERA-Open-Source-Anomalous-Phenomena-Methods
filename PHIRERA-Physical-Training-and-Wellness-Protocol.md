# OMARG PHIRERA Physical Training and Wellness Protocol

## Introduction

This protocol aims to equip PHIRERA team members with the physical capability and resilience required for effective fieldwork. The regimen focuses on diet, hydration, weather preparedness, stretching, and physical training.

## Diet and Hydration

### Healthy Diet Practices

1. **Protein**: Essential for muscle repair and energy. Opt for lean meats, fish, eggs, and plant-based proteins.
2. **Carbohydrates**: Provides sustained energy. Choose whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
3. **Fats**: Needed for long-term energy and brain function. Focus on healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and olive oil.
4. **Fiber**: Aids digestion and provides sustained energy. Include whole fruits, vegetables, and legumes in your diet.

### Hydration Practices

1. **Water**: At least 3 liters per day. Essential for physical performance and cognitive function.
2. **Electrolytes**: Replenish salts lost during physical exertion with sports drinks.

### Why it's Important

Maintaining a balanced diet and staying hydrated are crucial for long shifts and multi-day excursions. Proper nutrition ensures sustained energy levels and optimal physical performance.

## Weather Preparedness

1. **Hot Conditions**: Wear light, breathable clothing and stay hydrated.
2. **Cold Conditions**: Layer clothing and keep extremities covered.
3. **Rainy Conditions**: Use waterproof gear and moisture-wicking fabrics.

### Why it's Important

Being prepared for various weather conditions ensures safety and allows team members to focus on the investigation rather than battling the elements.

## Stretching Protocol

1. **Hamstring Stretch**: 30 seconds each leg
2. **Quad Stretch**: 30 seconds each leg
3. **Calf Stretch**: 30 seconds each leg
4. **Shoulder Stretch**: 30 seconds each side
5. **Neck Stretch**: 15 seconds each side

### Why it's Important

Stretching before physical activity reduces the risk of injury and improves overall flexibility, which is essential for navigating rough terrains.

## Physical Training Regimen

### Cardiovascular Training

- **Running**: 3 times a week, 30 minutes to 1 hour

### Why it's Important

A well-rounded physical training regimen prepares you for the demanding nature of fieldwork, from navigating rough terrains to carrying equipment.
