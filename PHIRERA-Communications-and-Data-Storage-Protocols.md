Absolutely, you've provided a very comprehensive breakdown of the existing processes, roles, and expectations. This level of detail will help us draft a robust and practical Communication Protocol document. The nuances like radio codes for efficient communication, data sanitization, and public engagement make it clear how you envision the flow of information both internally and externally.

Let's start drafting the "PHIRERA-Communication-Protocol.md" based on the points you've laid out. Given the multiple facets, we can structure the document into various sections:

---

# OMARG PHIRERA Communication Protocol

## Introduction

This document outlines the communication protocols for the Paranormal Holistic Investigative Research and Emergency Response to Anomalies (PHIRERA) Agency Department of the non-profit Omni-Method Advanced Research Group (OMARG). These protocols are essential for the seamless flow of information, data handling, and storage within the team and the broader community.

## Internal Communication

### 1. Reporting Hierarchy

- **Objective**: To establish a clear line of command.
- All team members report directly to the Head Organizer or Team Lead, primarily via Messenger or Discord.

---

### 2. In-Field Communication

- **Objective**: To ensure efficient and effective communication during fieldwork.
- Use predefined shorthand radio codes to preserve battery life and storage. refer to PHIRERA-Radio-Codes.md for a complete list of current codes.
- Stay in constant contact during investigations and responses with your team, and contact the Team Lead with significant updates or discoveries.

---

### 3. Report and Data Submission

- **Objective**: To streamline the submission of reports and raw data.
- Use official report forms from the repository.
- Include expense reports.
- For large data files, use the PHIRERA Google Drive account you were given access to.

### 4. Data Naming Standard

- **Objective**: To maintain consistency in data files.
- Name files using the format: `Date-Time-SiteID-ResearcherCodename-DataPoint.extension`.

---

### 5. Debriefing

- **Objective**: To assess and summarize the findings of field investigations.
- Conduct debrief meetings via Messenger, in person, or over the phone.

---

## Data Handling and Storage

### 1. Data Sanitization and Public Sharing

- **Objective**: To ensure the integrity and security of the data.
- Data will be sanitized properly before being shared via GitHub to the public.

---

### 2. Public Engagement and Response

- **Objective**: To involve the public in the research and response processes.
- Present findings and await public response for a reasonable time.
- Engage with the public for further refinement.

---

## Conclusion

Adherence to these communication protocols is mandatory for all team members. These protocols are designed to ensure the effective flow of information, maintain the integrity of the data, and engage the public in a meaningful way.

As with all of our documents and protocols, this is a living document and may be updated at any time with little to no notice, make sure to check for updates regularly.
