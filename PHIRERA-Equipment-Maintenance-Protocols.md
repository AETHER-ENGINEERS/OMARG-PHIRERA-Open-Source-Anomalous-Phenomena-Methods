# OMARG PHIRERA Equipment Maintenance Protocol A

## Introduction

This document outlines the necessary steps for maintaining, cleaning, and ensuring the functionality of the equipment used during field investigations. Proper equipment maintenance is crucial for accurate data collection and the overall success of the investigation.

---

## General Maintenance Guidelines

### 1. Storage and Transportation

- **Objective**: To protect equipment from damage during storage and transit.
- [ ] Use padded, shock-proof cases for sensitive equipment.
- [ ] Store all devices in Ziplock bags when not in use, during transit, or in inclement weather conditions like rain or snow.

---

### 2. Calibration

- **Objective**: To ensure accurate readings and functionality.
- [ ] Calibrate devices as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
- [ ] For RF detectors, use an RF-Free environment for zero-setting calibration. (An RF-Free environment is a setting where no active radio frequency signals are present.)

---

### 3. Cleaning

- **Objective**: To maintain equipment hygiene and functionality.
- [ ] Use a soft, lint-free cloth for cleaning lenses and screens.
- [ ] Use compressed air to remove dust from hard-to-reach places.

---

### 4. Battery Management

- **Objective**: To ensure uninterrupted power supply.
- [ ] Always carry extra batteries.
- [ ] Use rechargeable batteries whenever possible and ensure they are fully charged before fieldwork.

---

### 5. Magnetic Field Interference

- **Objective**: To avoid inaccurate readings due to magnetic interference.
- [ ] Keep equipment away from strong magnetic fields like those emitted by electrical transformers or heavy machinery.

---

### 6. Weather Conditions

- **Objective**: To prepare for various weather conditions.
- [ ] Use weather-resistant cases for equipment sensitive to moisture.
- [ ] Ensure devices with temperature-sensitive components are stored in climate-controlled environments.

---

### 7. Software Updates

- **Objective**: To keep the device firmware and software up-to-date.
- [ ] Regularly check for software and firmware updates and apply them as needed.

## General Maintenance Guidelines

### 1. Digital and Optical Equipment (Cameras, FLIR, Night Vision)

- **Objective**: To ensure optimal functionality and longevity.
- **Maintenance Steps**:
  - Clean lenses with a soft, lint-free cloth.
  - Check for firmware updates.
  - Store in ziplock bags when not in use, especially in adverse weather conditions.

---

### 2. Audio and Frequency Sensors (Audio Recorders, RF Detectors)

- **Objective**: To maintain sensor accuracy.
- **Maintenance Steps**:
  - Test in an "RF-Free environment" (an area with minimal radio frequency interference) before each use.
  - Clean and check ports and cables.
  - Update firmware if available.

---

### 3. Electromagnetic and Radiation Detectors (EMF Meters, Geiger Counters)

- **Objective**: To ensure accurate readings.
- **Maintenance Steps**:
  - Calibrate in an environment devoid of strong magnetic fields.
  - Check batteries and replace as needed.
  - Store in ziplock bags in adverse weather conditions.

---

### 4. Drones and Aerial Equipment

- **Objective**: To ensure safe and effective operation.
- **Maintenance Steps**:
  - Conduct pre-flight checks.
  - Check for firmware updates.
  - Ensure batteries are fully charged.

---

### 5. Vehicles

- **Objective**: To ensure safe and reliable transportation.
- **Maintenance Steps**:
  - Regular oil changes and service checks.
  - Keep emergency supplies (e.g., first aid, tools, water).
  - Clean the vehicle after each field investigation and dispose of trash responsibly.

---

### 6. First Aid Kit

- **Objective**: To ensure readiness for medical emergencies.
- **Maintenance Steps**:
  - Check expiry dates on medications.
  - Replenish supplies as needed.

---

### 7. General Site Maintenance

- **Objective**: To leave no trace at investigation sites.
- **Maintenance Steps**:
  - Bring trash bags to clean up the site and the vehicle.
  - Dispose of waste in designated disposal areas.

---

## Conclusion

Following these maintenance protocols is mandatory for all team members. These protocols are designed to extend the life of the equipment, ensure accurate data collection, and maintain the integrity of the research sites.
