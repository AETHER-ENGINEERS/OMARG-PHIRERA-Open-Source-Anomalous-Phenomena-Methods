OMARG-PHIRERA Official Threat Assessment Protocols.

Our approach to defining and categorizing threats is both comprehensive and nuanced, which is crucial given the complexity of the phenomena we're investigating. This will serve as the go-to excellent guideline for our team and any collaborators to assess and respond to various situations effectively.

### Threat Assessment and Response Protocol

#### Categories of Threats: Triple A
- *Alien*: Extraterrestrial technologies or residuals.
- *Anomalous*: Unexplained phenomena that defy known laws of physics or nature.
- *Ancient*: Technologies or residuals originating from ancient civilizations or times.

#### Threat Levels

##### Low Threat
- *Criteria*: No physiological or psychological harm observed in the affected region.
- *Examples*: Harmless residual energies, benign extraterrestrial activity, etc.
- *Response*: Research further to explore potential applications or benefits of the observed phenomena.

##### High Threat
- *Criteria*: Presence of harmful elements like high radioactivity, electromagnetic activity, animal mutilations, or weaponized technologies.
- *Examples*: Locations like Skinwalker Ranch, Bradshaw Ranch, or hazardous areas near Boston.
  
#### High Threat Response Protocol

1. *Diplomatic Measures*: Attempt to communicate with responsible entities, whether they are human, alien, or extradimensional, to halt or safely contain the activity.
2. *Physical Barriers*: Erect fencing, signage, or other forms of containment and warning.
3. *Shielding or Countermeasures*: Implement technology or methods to counteract or mitigate the harmful effects.
4. *Public Exposure and Accountability*: If diplomatic methods fail, expose the threat to the public, hold those responsible accountable, and shut it down.
